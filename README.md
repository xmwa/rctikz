# TikZ Code Generator for Reservoir Computing Illustrations

This repository contains tools to generate TikZ illustrations for reservoir computing architectures, such as Echo State Networks (ESNs) and Liquid State Machines (LSMs).

## Overview

Reservoir computing models typically consist of three main components:
1. An input layer
2. A reservoir layer (with random, recurrent connections)
3. A readout layer

Creating illustrations for these architectures can be challenging, particularly for visualizing the complex, randomly connected neurons within the reservoir layer. This tool simplifies the process by generating TikZ code that can be used in LaTeX documents.

## Features

- Generate illustrations for various reservoir computing architectures
- Customize network parameters (number of neurons, connection density, etc.)
- Export clean TikZ code ready for inclusion in academic papers and presentations
